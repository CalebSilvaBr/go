# Instructions

Implement a 24 hours clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes and hours to it.

Positive or negative minutes or hours that overflow time limits must be taken into consideration.

Examples:

New(-1, 10)
=> Returns: 23:10
New(5, -120)
=> Returns: 03:00

The Add and Subtract methods must also take this in consideration.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.
